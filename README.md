# SMS Spam Classifier

## Overview

The SMS Spam Classifier is a machine learning project that classifies SMS messages as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). The project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques combined with machine learning algorithms to automatically detect spam messages. This classifier is trained on a publicly available SMS dataset and can be used to filter spam messages in SMS-based systems.

## Features

- Classifies SMS messages into "spam" or "ham"
- Preprocessing includes tokenization, stemming, and vectorization
- Built with Python and popular libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Numpy
- Easily deployable for spam detection in SMS applications
